# Contribution guidelines

* Install/update the dependencies.
  `npm install`
* Make sure the code lints.
  `npm run lint`
* Make sure all of the tests pass.
  `npm test`
* New code must have new unit tests.
* New features/metrics
  or changes to existing features/metrics
  must be documented in the [readme] file.
* Adhere to the coding conventions
  that are used elsewhere in the codebase.
* Add yourself to the [authors] file.
* Feel free to [open an issue][newissue] first,
  if the change is one that you think
  needs some discussion.
  I'm not precious
  about the [issue list][issues].
